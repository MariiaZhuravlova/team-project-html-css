                    Twenty five years ago, we set out to create top-notch ice cream, using the organic milk made on our farm in a little village hidden away amongst the gentle hills of North East Wales. 
                                  </li>
                <li class="cow-text">We soon converted a little barn and from it, eagerly worked towards our goal; to make a family of ice creams that would be second to none in their taste and creamy texture.</li>
