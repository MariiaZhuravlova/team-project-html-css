                        Twenty five years ago, we set out to create top-notch ice cream, using the organic milk made on our farm
                        in a little village hidden away amongst the gentle hills of North East Wales.
                    </li>
                    <li class="cow-text">We soon converted a little barn and from it, eagerly worked towards our goal; to make a
                        family of ice creams that would be second to none in their taste and creamy texture.</li>

                    Most ice cream is made with lots of heavy cream and eggs. It tastes delicious but it’s not very health-conscious. Using
                    milk can be a tasty and healthier alternative to traditional cream. For something a little richer, try an ice cream made
                    with sweetened condensed milk. <span>🍨</span>
